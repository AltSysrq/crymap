/// 4.1.3 is doable, but it's not great. Apparently Cyrus does this. It forces
/// clients to guess what happened.
///
/// The main concern with 4.1.2 is apparently insane clients that think it
/// somehow makes sense to immediately retry a request that resulted in `NO`
/// immediately. Arnt Gulbrandsen in the IMAP mailing list wrote about a hybrid
/// approach on 2006-09-15:

/// > a client fetches a message which another client has expunged, but whose
/// > expunge has not yet been reported in this session, the server issues a

/// > are fetched again before the server can report the expunge, the server

///
/// ("4.1.1+period" refers to a scheme of using 4.1.1 by way of a 5-minute or
/// more grace period, followed by Dovecot 4 for attempts that happen later.)
