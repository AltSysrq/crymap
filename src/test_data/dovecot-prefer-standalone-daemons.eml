I always prefer standalone daemons, and as we see the tendency is that
most server run as standalone (apache, vsftpd, ssh...). at the begining
they has (x)inetd version later remove it...
IMHO ip/tcp filtering should have done in a firewall or some fitering
can be implemented in the standalone server too..
but this is just my 2c:-)
